# Reinforcement learning for ramp metering on highways

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to employ reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically Qlearning and Deep Q-learning, to enhance the control of ramp metering on highways. Through numerical simulations using SUMO, we aim to develop an algorithm that optimizes the flow of traffic on both the highway stretch and the entering ramp.

## Requirements
- Python
- SUMO
- TensorFlow and Keras
- Traffic Control Interface (traci)
- sumolib  

## Models
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Learning  

Recommendations
Future work may involve exploring more advanced RL techniques, incorporating additional parameters into the state space, and considering real-world implementations. Collaboration with traffic engineering experts and urban planners could enhance the practical applicability of the developed model.
